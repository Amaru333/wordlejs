/**
  * Wordle on your browser console.
  * This program is a small game where you'll have to guess a 5 letter word and you'll have 5 chances to do so. After every chance, you get a hint on whether your answer
  * is right or wrong. Green means the letter is placed in right position. Yellow means the letter is present in the word but in wrong position. Black means the letter is
  * not present in the word.
  *
  * NOTE: Paste this code in an online compiler or your browser's console and test it, as prompts doesn't work in local node environment.
  * 
  * IF COLOR EMOJIS ARE NOT APPEARING IN THIS FILE, OR IF IT'S BROKEN, I HAVE PUSHED THE CODE INTO GITHUB REPOSITORY. PLEASE ACCESS IT IN THIS URL:
